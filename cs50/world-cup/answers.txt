Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

It seems that the predictions all remained relativly in the same order no matter the simulations. Just with slightly different probablilaties.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 1000 simulations.
